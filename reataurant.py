#you are at a restaurant waiting to eat something delicious 😋 

# #but the restaurant is too crowded 😕

# you being smart 😎 want to figure out the time it would take before its your turn
# the restaurant offers 5 products:
# 🍕 pizza - 15 mins 
# 🍔 burger - 10 mins
# 🍝 pasta - 10 mins
# 🍩 donut - 5 mins

# for simplicity, assume the restaurant has a policy that one person can only order one item.

# you have a friend working at the restaurant 👨‍🍳who helps you in getting the input on no. of people and their orders:
print("1>pizza--------15min")
print("2>Burger-------10min")
print("3>pasta--------10min")

no_of_customer=input("enter the number of customer=")
order_item=input("enter the number of item=")
order.append(order_item)
print(order)
